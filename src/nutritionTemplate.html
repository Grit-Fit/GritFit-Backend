      here‚Äôs a breakdown of your maintenance calories, target calories, macro splits, and some delicious food sources
      to hit those goals. Let‚Äôs dive in!
    </p>
    <hr>
    
    <h2>1. Your Maintenance Calories üí™</h2>
    <p>
      To keep your body running like a well-oiled machine, you need about <strong>{{maintenanceCalories}}</strong>
      calories per day. This is the magic number that keeps you from turning into a couch potato or a gym rat‚Äîjust the perfect balance!
    </p>
    <hr>

    <h2>2. Your Target Calories üéØ</h2>
    <p>Depending on your goals, here‚Äôs how many calories you should be consuming daily:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bulk Up:</strong> For muscle gains, aim for <strong>{{targetCaloriesBulk}}</strong> calories. Time to unleash your inner beast!</li>
      <li><strong>Cut Down:</strong> If you want to shed some extra fluff, target <strong>{{targetCaloriesCut}}</strong> calories. Beach body, here you come!</li>
      <li><strong>Recomp:</strong> Just looking to keep things steady? Stick with <strong>{{maintenanceCalories}}</strong> calories. You‚Äôre perfect the way you are!</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>

    <h2>3. Macro Split Breakdown ü•öüçé</h2>
    
    <!-- <ul>
      <li><strong>Protein:</strong> <strong>{{proteinGrams}}</strong> grams</li>
      <li><strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> <strong>{{carbGrams}}</strong> grams</li>
      <li><strong>Fats:</strong> <strong>{{fatGrams}}</strong> grams</li>
    </ul> -->

    <h3> Why These Macros Matter?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Proteins:</strong> Protein is essential for <strong>building and repairing tissues</strong>, producing enzymes and hormones, and supporting overall muscle and immune function.  
        It plays a critical role in recovery after workouts and helps maintain lean body mass, making it an essential component for athletes and fitness enthusiasts. 
        High-protein foods include <strong>meats, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes, and plant-based sources like tofu and quinoa</strong>.</li>

      <li><strong>Fats:</strong> Fats are crucial for <strong>energy production, hormone balance, brain function, and the absorption of essential vitamins</strong> (A, D, E, and K).  
        They also contribute to <strong>cell membrane integrity and joint lubrication</strong>, making them vital for overall health.  
        <strong>Healthy fat sources include avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish</strong>.</li>

      <li><strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> Carbohydrates are the body's <strong>primary energy source</strong>, fueling daily activities and vital bodily functions.  
        They are particularly important for <strong>high-intensity workouts</strong> and <strong>muscle glycogen replenishment</strong> after exercise.  
        Whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes are excellent sources of <strong>complex carbohydrates</strong>, which provide sustained energy and dietary fiber for digestive health.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Now, let‚Äôs get into the nitty-gritty of your macros! Here‚Äôs how your calories should be split:</p>

    <div class="table-container">

        <tr>
          <th>Macronutrient</th>
          <th>Cutting</th>
          <th>Bulking</th>
          <th>Recomp</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Protein (g)</strong></td>
          <td>{{proteinCut}}</td>
          <td>{{proteinBulk}}</td>
          <td>{{proteinRecomp}}</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Fats (g)</strong></td>
          <td>{{fatCut}}</td>
          <td>{{fatBulk}}</td>
